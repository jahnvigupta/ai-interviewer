Given an array of integers nums and an integer target,
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
